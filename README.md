# Data-Viz-New-York-City-Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Analysis
Introduction

Every year in NYC there are over 40 thousand traffic crashes where someone is injured. The vast majority of these injuries are minor. Around 250 crashes are fatal, but many more result in serious injuries, close to death, with potentially long-term effects on the injured and their loved ones. With such a high toll on human life, I wanted to understand what are the different factors that cause injuries during motor vehicle collisions and also to analyze and present insights that would identify high-probability factors causing injuries during collisions. This project aims to delve into the patterns and factors associated with motor vehicle collisions in New York City. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of collision incidents, my goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to accident causes, timings, locations, and contributing factors, as well as the resulting human impact in terms of injuries and fatalities, and to present these insights through interactive visualization. For the analysis, I have taken the NYC Motor Vehicle collision dataset covering a rich dataset of all the collisions that occurred in New York City from 2018 to 2023. Finally, I have presented my learnings from theanalysis and highlighted the scope and future potential of my work.

Dataset Description

1. Primary dataset - Motor Vehicle Collision Data â€“ Crashes
   
The Motor Vehicle Collision data on crashes is observational data obtained from NYC Open Data. It contains records of crash events that have occurred in NYC. I obtained data from 2018 to 2023.

2. Secondary dataset Weather Underground Daily Weather Data (2018 -2023)
   
Weather data is obtained from the Weather Underground Website(WU), which contains information on temperature, wind, humidity, wind speed, wind gusts, pressure, precipitation, and condition. I scraped the weather data for 5 years from the website.
